This is a clone of adenbeckitt's general fix from ehsmaes' version. It's supposed to work with Raspbian Jessie, but it didn't for me, so I'm modifying it.  

Original instructions from ehsmaes found here:

I'm planning to use this along with daniel-j's Si4713 Pi setup to receive over bluetooth and rebroadcast over FM to a hot chasis tube radio that isn't very accomidating to direct input.
